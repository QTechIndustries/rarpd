* arp cache management via netlink (beware of tainted data)

* identify possibly blocking io and use nonblocking socket io

* check netlink error handling

* commandline options, at least rarpd [-adflt] if0 [... ifN] (see OpenBSD rarpd(8))
  should be supported.

* daemonize and write pidfile

* some kind of priviledge seperation ie. fork for arp cache management, pass the open
  fds to an unprivileged process.

* use capabilities (7) CAP_NET_RAW for socket handling and CAP_NET_ADMIN for arp cache,
  drop all others

* signal handling (is this necessary ?)
